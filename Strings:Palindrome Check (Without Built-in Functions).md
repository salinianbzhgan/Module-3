# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the string `"google"` is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the string `"google"` to a variable.
2. Reverse the string manually using slicing (`[::-1]`).
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
   - If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4. Execute the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
Devolped by :SALINI A
Reg no      :212223220091
```
```
string="google" 
if string==string[::-1]: 
   print ("The entered string is palindrome") else: 
   print ("The entered string is not palindrome")
```

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
